## 1. Reinterpreting Time in General Relativity (Without Breaking It)

We do not replace the coordinate time $( t )$ in Einstein’s equations with proper time $( \tau )$. Instead, we reinterpret what **proper time already is** and what the **metric is actually measuring**. This move is fully compatible with General Relativity (GR) and does not alter its formal structure.

In GR:

- Coordinate time $ ( t )$ is a gauge choice and has no direct physical meaning.
- Proper time $( \tau )$ is what clocks measure along worldlines.

Our proposal aligns exactly with this structure. We do not introduce a new time variable; we give **proper time a deeper microphysical meaning**.

------

## 2. Proper Time as Causal Commitment

In standard GR, proper time is defined by:
$$
d\tau^2 = - g_{\mu\nu} , dx^\mu dx^\nu
$$

We reinterpret this as follows:
$$
d\tau ;;\longleftrightarrow;; \sum (\text{causally committed transitions along the path})
$$

In continuum form:
$$
d\tau = \rho(x), d\lambda
$$
where:

- $ \rho(x) $ is the **local density / rate of causal commitment**
- $ d\lambda $ is a **pre-temporal ordering parameter**, not time

This means:

- Clocks tick because transitions irreversibly commit
- Slower clocks correspond to lower commitment rates
- Faster clocks correspond to higher commitment rates

This reinterpretation accommodates:

- Gravitational time dilation
- Velocity time dilation
- Breakdown of clocks near horizons

without modifying the equations of GR.

------

## 3. Where Einstein’s Equation Actually Lives

Einstein’s field equation,
$$
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G , T_{\mu\nu},
$$
contains **no explicit time variable**.

It relates:

- Geometry $( G_{\mu\nu} )$
- To energy–momentum $( T_{\mu\nu} )$

Time enters GR only through:

- The metric
- Proper time along worldlines

Thus the real question becomes: **What is the physical origin of the metric and of $ T_{\mu\nu} $?**

------

## 4. Transition Density as the Source of Curvature

We introduce the physical postulate:

> **Energy corresponds to the density of causally committed transitions.**

Define:
$$
\rho_{\text{trans}}(x)
= \text{number of committed transitions per unit causal volume}
$$

Then:

- High energy $ \Rightarrow$ high transition density
- High transition density $ \Rightarrow$  altered clock rates
- Spatial gradients of transition density $ \Rightarrow$  curvature

This reproduces Jacobson’s result:
$$
\text{Einstein equation} = \text{equation of state of spacetime}
$$

In our language:

> **Curvature is the macroscopic response of the causal graph to inhomogeneous commitment density.**

------



## 5. Energy–Momentum Tensor as Transition Flow

In standard physics:

- $T_{\mu\nu}$ encodes energy, momentum, pressure, stress

In our ontology:

- These are projections of **transition flow**

Specifically:

- $T_{00}$: rate of causal commitment (energy density)
- $T_{0i}$: directional bias of commitment propagation (momentum)
- $T_{ij}$: constraints on adjacency updates (stress / pressure)

Thus Einstein’s equation states:

> Geometry adjusts so that causal commitment rates remain consistent.

No new mathematics, only new ontology.

------

## 6. Why We Must Not Replace $t \to \tau$ Explicitly

Replacing coordinate time directly would break:

- Lorentz invariance
- Diffeomorphism invariance
- Covariance

Instead:

- $t$ remains a coordinate label
- $\tau$ remains path-dependent and physical

Exactly as in GR. Our contribution is not formal substitution, but explanation:

> **Proper time is not primitive; it is accumulated causal commitment.**

------

## 7. Conceptual Shift 

| Standard GR               | This Framework                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Proper time is geometric  | Proper time is computational               |
| Metric is fundamental     | Metric is emergent                         |
| Curvature is primitive    | Curvature = commitment-density gradient    |
| Time dilation unexplained | Time dilation = altered commitment mapping |

GR remains intact; its interpretation becomes causal and physical.

------

## 8. A Safe Bridge Equation

One compact equation we can safely write is:
$$
d\tau = \alpha , \rho_{\text{commit}}(x), ds
$$
where:

- $ds$ is the invariant interval
- $\rho_{\text{commit}}$ is local commitment density
- $\alpha$ fixes units

This states:

> Proper time equals weighted accumulation of committed transitions.

------

## 9. Resolving the Apparent Commitment Paradox

Two statements seem contradictory:

1. Higher commitment rate $ \Rightarrow$ faster clock
2. Higher commitment density $ \Rightarrow$ more gravity $ \Rightarrow$ slower clock

The resolution is frame-dependent.

### Local View (Equivalence Principle)

- Commitment density is high
- Interactions are intense
- Clock is perfectly normal to itself

### Relational View

- Dense regions distort comparability
- Mapping between distant commitment counts is warped
- Clock appears slowed from outside

Correct statement:

> **Dense commitment enriches local time but deforms relational timing.**

This is exactly gravitational time dilation.

------

## 10. Pre-Temporal Quantum Evolution

Schrödinger’s equation,
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = H\psi,
$$
does **not** describe time passing.

In this framework:

- Schrödinger evolution occurs **before commitment**
- It evolves possibilities, not events
- It lives in a pre-time parameter $\lambda$

Correct rewrite:
$$
i\hbar \frac{d\psi}{d\lambda} = H\psi,
\qquad
d\tau = \rho_{\text{commit}} , d\lambda
$$

Collapse is not time evolution; **Collapse is time creation.**

------

## 11. What $d\tau$ Encodes

$( d\tau )$ is not duration.
It is not a tick.
It is not a parameter.

It encodes:
$$
d\tau ;\propto; \text{irreversible causal information committed to the future}
$$

Each increment corresponds to:

- Decoherence
- Completion of interaction
- Export of irreversible information

If nothing commits, time does not advance.

------

## 12. Assigning a Real Quantity to $d\tau$

Define:
$$
d\tau \equiv dI_{\text{commit}} \quad \text{(measured in bits)}
$$
Using Landauer:
$$
dE \ge k_B T \ln 2 , d\tau
$$
Thus:

- Time is literally counted commitment
- Energy and temperature bound time creation

Clocks are devices that commit bits at stable rates.

------

## 13. Plugging into GR

Standard GR:
$$
d\tau^2 = - g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu
$$
Becomes:
$$
dI_{\text{commit}}^2 = - g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu
$$
Discrete simulation rule:

1. Propose $\Delta x^\mu$
2. Compute $\Delta \tau_{\text{geom}}$
3. Compute $\Delta \tau_{\max} = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B T \ln 2}$
4. Actual:
$$
   \Delta \tau = \min(\Delta \tau_{\text{geom}}, \Delta \tau_{\max})
$$
Geometry requests time; thermodynamics permits it.

------

## 14. Planck Time as Bit-Rate Limit

Planck quantities:
$$
t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}},
\quad
E_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}},
\quad
T_P = \frac{E_P}{k_B}
$$
Landauer cost at $( T_P )$:
$$
E_{\text{bit}} = k_B T_P \ln 2 \approx 1.36 \times 10^9 , \text{J}
$$
Compare:
$$
\frac{E_{\text{bit}}}{E_P} \approx 1.44
$$
Thus:

- One Planck energy commits ~1.44 bits
- One bit corresponds to:
$$
  \tau \approx \frac{t_P}{1.44}
$$
**Planck time is not a chronon.**
It is the **maximum bit-rate limit**.

------

## 15. The True Tau of Physics

$d\tau$ is:

- Local
- Variable
- Physical
- Real

Macroscopic time emerges as an average:
$$
\langle \tau \rangle ;\approx; \text{smooth classical time}
$$

Final statement:

> **$d\tau$ is the locally real, variable proper time created by irreversible causal commitment, whose large-scale average reproduces smooth relativistic time.**

------

## 16. Final Synthesis

- Events are discrete (bits)
- Time is emergent (accumulated commitment)
- Geometry is informational bookkeeping
- Gravity is commitment-density curvature
- Planck time is a rate limit, not a tick
- The universe is a causally gated computation

**This is a computational theory of the universe, in a literal, physical sense.**
