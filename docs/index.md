# Functional Universe - Index

An Interpretive Framework and a **[Computational Model](https://github.com/VoxleOne/FunctionalUniverse/tree/dev)**

Functional Universe (FU) is a formal framework for modeling physical reality as functional state evolution, integrating sequential composition with simultaneous aggregation.
It provides a unified language for causal dynamics, background effects, and recoverability across classical physics, general relativity, and quantum field theory.

This documentation presents the conceptual foundations, mathematical structures, and physical interpretations of the model.
