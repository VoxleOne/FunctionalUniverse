# **Feynman Diagrams in the Functional Universe**

### 1. Functional Interpretation of Diagrams

In the Functional Universe (FU), **Feynman diagrams are not literal pictures of particles moving through spacetime**, but rather **compositional graphs of allowed transitions**:

* **Vertices** = bookends of a transition
* **Internal lines** = aggregation-mediated evolution $(\mathcal{A})$
* **External lines** = stabilized patterns, i.e., successor interface states

> Transitions are verbs; particles are stabilized nouns. The diagram depicts a **process**, not objects in motion.

### 2. Two-Vertex, Sine-Wave-as-$d\tau$ Picture

Consider a standard QFT process: an electron $(e^-)$ and a positron $(e^+)$ annihilate to produce a quark–antiquark pair. In FU terms:

1. **Left vertex**: input interface $(f_n)$, where the collision initiates possible interactions
2. **Internal line / sine wave**: the **transition itself**, $(d\Tau)$, where aggregation explores multiple possibilities
3. **Right vertex**: committed successor state $(f_{n+1}$), where proper time increments and a new interface is realized

* **Vertices** are “ends” of the transition
* **Sine line** is the minimum-duration transition mandated by axiom 2 $(d\tau_{\min})$
* **Output quarks** are $f_{n+1}$, which will themselves rapidly participate in further transitions

Formally, the transition is:

$$
f_n \xrightarrow{d\tau} f_{n+1}, \quad
d\tau = \int_{\lambda_{\rm init}}^{\lambda_{\rm commit}} \mathcal{A}(\text{possible transitions}), d\lambda
$$

* $\lambda$ = pre-temporal ordering parameter in aggregation space
* $\mathcal{A}$ = aggregation of all potential functional evolutions
* Proper time only accumulates at **commitment**, $f_{n+1} = \mathcal{C}(d\tau)$

### 3. Why This Rearrangement

1. **Corrects “wavy line as a particle” intuition**: the internal line represents the evolving transition, not a physical photon.
2. **Makes minimum $d\tau$ explicit**: the diagram becomes almost a picture of the process duration.
3. **Shows compositional nature**: left vertex = input interface; right vertex = committed output; internal line = aggregation mediation.
4. **Emphasizes continuation**: output quarks are $f_{n+1}$ but will immediately participate in subsequent transitions $(f_{n+2}, f_{n+3}, \dots)$, preserving causality and proper-time accumulation.

### 4. Virtual Particles as Aggregations

Internal lines:

* Represent aggregation, $\mathcal{A}$, not committed states
* May interfere, recombine, or cancel
* Become **real only when composed**, e.g., boundary conditions, decoherence, or interaction with external systems

Thus a “virtual photon” is **not a particle**, but a **phase of the transition** mediating between input and output interfaces.

### 5. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Representation

Every Feynman diagram can be interpreted as a DAG of transitions:

* **Vertices** = committed interfaces
* **Edges** = composability constraints (causal and symmetry rules)
* **Weights** = amplitudes derived from aggregation statistics

Transition composition is naturally expressed:

$$
f_{n+1} = \mathcal{C}(d\tau) \circ f_n
$$

Subsequent transitions chain to form worldlines:

$$
f_n \xrightarrow{d\tau_n} f_{n+1} \xrightarrow{d\tau_{n+1}} f_{n+2} \xrightarrow{\dots}
$$

Each $d\tau$ satisfies the **minimum proper-time axiom**, guaranteeing discrete, irreversible causal steps.

### 6. Summary

* **Vertices** = input/output of transitions 
* **Internal lines** = $d\tau$ transition exploring aggregation possibilities
* **Output states** = committed successor $f_{n+1}$
* **Virtual particles** = aggregation mediators, not independent entities
* **Proper time** accumulates only at commitment

> Feynman diagrams are thus **natural graphical representations of causal composition in the Functional Universe**, directly reflecting the structure of reality as sequences of irreducible transitions.
