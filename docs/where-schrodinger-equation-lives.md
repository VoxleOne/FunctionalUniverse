# Where the Schrödinger equation lives (and why)

In this framework the Schrödinger equation:
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t},|\psi\rangle = \hat H |\psi\rangle
$$

it is **not** a law of history creation. It is a law governing:

* evolution of *possibilities*,
* redistribution of aggregation weights,
* phase interference and compatibility,
* structure of the aggregation landscape.

That means:

* it does **not** advance proper time $(d\tau)$,
* it does **not** produce entropy,
* it does **not** write to the causal log,
* it does **not** define events.

So it cannot live in $\mathcal C$.

It lives squarely in **$\mathcal A$**.

## Reinterpretation in FU terms

In Functional Universe language:

* Schrödinger evolution updates
$$
  \mathcal A(f_n) ;\rightarrow; \mathcal A'(f_n)
$$
* Commitment applies
$$
  f_{n+1} = \mathcal C(\mathcal A(f_n))
$$

Analogy: Picture many tributary streams flowing from all directions, merging at a waterfall. The Schrödinger equation governs how the tributary aggregations interfere and interact upstream of the waterfall. Commitment governs whether the waterfall occurs at all, producing a cascade that advances proper time and creates historical events.

## Why this avoids confusion

This cleanly separates things that standard QM blurs:

| Standard QM                                 | FU resolution                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| “Wavefunction evolves in time”              | Aggregation is parameterized, not temporal            |
| “Collapse interrupts Schrödinger evolution” | Collapse = exit from $\mathcal A$                     |
| “Measurement problem”                       | Mixing $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal C$                  |
| “Unitary vs non-unitary”                    | Unitary in $\mathcal A$, irreversible in $\mathcal C$ |

There is **no contradiction** because they are not acting in the same ontological layer.

## Seriality + Schrödinger = no conflict

Because:

* Schrödinger evolution is **parallel, reversible, pre-historical**
* Composition is **serial, irreversible, historical**
* Seriality applies **only after** commitment
* Schrödinger dynamics never commits anything by itself

So saying:

> “Composition is serial per worldline”

and

> “The Schrödinger equation lives in $mathcal A$”

are not just compatible; they *require* each other.

## Summary

> **The Schrödinger equation governs the evolution of possibility; serial composition governs the creation of history.**
