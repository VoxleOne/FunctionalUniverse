##  1. Ontological Status of Spacetime

In this model, spacetime is **not fundamental**. It is not the arena in which physics happens, but a **derived bookkeeping structure** that summarizes deeper processes. What spacetime encodes is:

* Causally committed events
* Their partial ordering
* Their relational adjacency

Spacetime is therefore a *coarse-grained description* of an underlying causal structure. It does not exist independently of physical processes; it is inferred from them.

## 2. Fundamental Replacement for Spacetime

At the base level, the ontology contains:

* Irreversibly committed transitions
* **Edges**: allowed propagation of committed information
* No metric
* No coordinates
* No background manifold

Formally, reality is a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of committed transitions.

* Direction of edges ⇒ causal order (time)
* Graph adjacency ⇒ relational structure (space)

This places the model closer to **causal sets, spin networks, and process graphs** than to classical spacetime physics.

## 3. Emergence of Time from Causal Order

Time emerges from the structure of the DAG itself.

* A **timelike direction** is a chain of composable transitions
* A **clock** is a stable, repetitive subgraph
* **Duration** is the number or weighted rate of transitions along a chain

There is no global time coordinate. Only:

* Path length
* Transition density

This immediately produces:

* Time dilation (different path densities)
* Absence of global simultaneity

Time is path-dependent by construction.

## 4. Emergence of Space from Causal Independence

Space is not dual to time; it is constructed differently.

Two events are spatially near if:

* They are causally independent
* They share many common neighbors
* Or they exchange information with similar sets of events

Thus, spatial distance is defined relationally:

$$
\text{Distance} \sim \text{effort required to correlate two spacelike events}
$$

This is an **information-theoretic distance**, closely aligned with:

* Graph distance
* Information distance
* Entanglement geometry

Space is similarity of causal neighborhoods, not a container.

## 5. Origin of the Spacetime Metric

The spacetime metric is **not fundamental**. It emerges statistically from:

* Density of committed events
* Variation in transition rates
* Constraints on information flow

In smooth, dense regimes:

* The DAG approximates a Lorentzian manifold
* Light cones emerge as maximal information speed
* Curvature corresponds to inhomogeneous transition density

In extreme regimes:

* The manifold description breaks down
* Only the causal graph remains

Spacetime is therefore an *effective description*, not a universal one.

## 6. Gravity as Compositional Bias

Gravity is not geometry-first in this model.

Instead:

* Energy increases transition density
* Higher density shortens compositional paths
* Paths preferentially bend toward dense regions

Geodesics are reinterpreted as **paths of least compositional resistance**.

In the continuum limit, this reproduces:

* Curved spacetime behavior
* Einstein’s equations in spirit (as an equation of state)

This aligns naturally with:

* Jacobson’s thermodynamic gravity
* Entropic gravity approaches
* Causal set gravity

## 7. Status of Spacetime Points

Spacetime points do not exist fundamentally.

What exists:

* Events (committed transitions)
* Relations (who can affect whom)

Coordinates are maps, not territory. A spacetime point is merely:

> A convenient label for a dense equivalence class of events.

## 8. Regimes Where Spacetime Breaks Down

Spacetime fails precisely where it should:

* Long superposition windows
* Weak decoherence
* Delayed causal commitment

Examples include:

* Black hole horizons
* The early universe
* Deep quantum regimes

In these regions:

* Time thins
* Space loses meaning
* Only causal potential exists

---

## 9. Summary

Spacetime is the large-scale, coarse-grained shadow of a deeper causal graph of committed transitions; its apparent smoothness reflects frequent and uniform commitment.
