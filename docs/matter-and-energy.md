# Matter and Energy in the Functional Universe

## 1. Introduction

In the Functional Universe (FU), both matter and energy emerge **from the fundamental dynamics of transitions**, without invoking primitive particles, fields, or forces. This document presents a coherent description linking **standing patterns of transitions**, **energy**, and **entropy**, illustrating how matter stabilizes, persists, and interacts under the FU framework.

## 2. Standing Patterns of Transitions: Matter

Matter is understood as a **stabilized pattern of transitions**. Individual transitions continue to occur, but they recur or reinforce one another in a locally consistent pattern, producing persistence and coherence.

* **Transitions occurring “in place”**: analogous to standing waves, the pattern oscillates while remaining locally stable.
* **States** are snapshots after the interval $d\tau$, recording boundary conditions without being primitive.
* **Collisions and perturbations** break patterns and create new structures.

Formally:

Let $T(t)$ be the set of transitions at time $(t)$. A **Standing Pattern of Transitions (SPT)** $P(t) \subseteq T(t)$ satisfies:

1. Spatial/structural location remains approximately constant over successive intervals:
   $$
   \forall k \in [1, n], \quad \text{dist}(\text{loc}(\tau_{t+k d\tau}), \text{loc}(\tau_t)) < \epsilon
   $$
2. Transition outputs reinforce inputs of the next step: (C(\tau_{t+k d\tau}) = 1)
3. The pattern persists under normal perturbations: (p_\text{stability} \approx 1)

Matter can then be identified as the **maximally self-reinforcing SPT**, where the sum of committed contributions is maximal:

$$
\text{Matter} = \operatorname{argmax}*{P(t) \subseteq T(t)} \sum*{\tau \in P} C(\tau)
$$

## 3. Entropy Increment

Each committed transition carries a **minimum entropy increment**:

* Records the irreversibility of the transition
* Establishes the arrow of time
* Ensures physical transitions cannot be undone

Formally, for a pattern (P):

$$
\Delta S(P) = \sum_{\tau \in P} \Delta S(\tau), \quad \Delta S(\tau) \ge S_\text{min}
$$

* Low local entropy increment → stable matter
* High local entropy increment → destabilization, collisions, creation of new patterns

## 4. Energy as Transition Potential

Energy is defined in FU as the **capacity of transitions to induce further transitions or destabilize existing patterns**. It is directly linked to **entropy increments**:

$$
E(P) \sim \text{Var}[\text{next transitions from } P] \sim \Delta S(P)
$$

* Stable matter → low energy, low entropy growth
* High-energy interactions → high variance in potential transitions → rapid entropy increase
* Collisions, cosmic rays, and high-energy phenomena are naturally described as patterns breaking, reforming, and generating new standing patterns



## 5. Conceptual Summary

| Concept                  | FU Interpretation                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Matter                   | Persistent, self-reinforcing patterns of transitions (SPTs)                   |
| Energy                   | Capacity to generate or destabilize transitions, linked to entropy increments |
| Entropy                  | Minimum irreversibility per committed transition, establishes arrow of time   |
| Collision / Perturbation | Breaks or reforms SPTs, redistributing energy and entropy                     |

> In FU, **matter is transitory**: it persists only so long as its constituent transitions reinforce one another.
> Energy and entropy emerge naturally from the dynamics, without invoking classical metaphysics, forces, or primitive entities.

## 6. Implications

* **Collisions and cosmic rays** are modeled as transitions destabilizing existing SPTs and generating new patterns
* **Arrow of time** is emergent from irreversible transition commitments
* **Stable matter** is an emergent, low-energy structure within a sea of ongoing transitions
