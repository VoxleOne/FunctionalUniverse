# README for Functional Universe

## Recent Refactoring Changes

This document outlines the recent changes made in the Functional Universe project, focusing on various architectural updates.

### Aggregation vs. Composition

Aggregation and composition are two fundamental concepts in software design. Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent, while composition implies that the child cannot exist without the parent. This distinction is important for understanding the ownership and lifecycle of components within our architecture.

### Causal Graph Implementation

The Causal Graph has been implemented to enhance the way dependencies and events are managed within the application. This new structure allows for more predictable interactions among different components, greatly improving the overall reliability of the Functional Universe system.

### PotentialTransition Updates

Recent updates have refined the PotentialTransition mechanisms to better handle state changes and transitions. With these changes, we are able to ensure smoother transitions and a more coherent state management process throughout the application.

### Visualization/Parallelism Enhancements

Enhancements have been made to the visualization tools, aiming to provide clearer insights into the system's operations. Additionally, improvements in parallelism have been introduced, allowing for more efficient processing and better utilization of system resources.

## Conclusion

These updates contribute significantly to the overall architecture of the Functional Universe project, ensuring we remain on the cutting edge of software design principles and efficient processing techniques.
